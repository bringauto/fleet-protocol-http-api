# Fleet v2 server


The HTTP API is described by the `openapi.yaml` according to [OpenAPI Specification](https://openapis.org).

The base of the server (e.g., entity models) was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. This includes ALL the contents of the `server/fleetv2_http_api` directory EXCEPT for:
- `impl`,
- `controllers/security_controller.py` (originally created by the Generator).

These files are included in the `server/.openapi-generator-ignore`. This file also must include itself.


## Requirements
Python 3.10.12+

## Server re-generation
You must have the OpenAPI Generator installed (see [link](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/)). Before the server generation, the server must be STOPPED.

To regenerate the server, run (in the `server` directory):
```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -g python-flask -i ../openapi.yaml -o . -p=packageName=fleetv2_http_api
```
Below is an example of running the Generator with the port number being specified (the default is `8080`):
```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -g python-flask -i ../openapi.yaml -o . -p=packageName=fleetv2_http_api,serverPort=<port-number>
```
If you have trouble with running the generator, visit [docs](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/).


## Tests

### Unit tests

You can run unit tests for the server by running `./test_server.sh` in the root directory. Do not forget to install the requirements as shown in the [usage](#usage) section.

### Integration tests

In the root folder, there is a package `integration_tests`. To run then, use

```bash
python -m integration_tests [-h] [PATH1] [PATH2] ...
```

Each PATH is specified relative to the `tests` folder. If no PATH is specified, all the tests will run. Otherwise,
- when PATH is a directory, the script will run all tests in this directory (and subdirectories),
- when PATH is a Python file, the script will run all tests in the file.

The `-h` flag makes the script display tests' coverage in HTML format, for example in your web browser.

## Usage

To run the server execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m server <path-to-config-file> [OPTIONS]
```
The server automatically connects to the PostgreSQL database using data from the config file. If you want to override these values, start the server with some of the following options:

|Option|Short|Description|
|------------|-----|--|
|`--username`|`-usr`|Username for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--password`|`-pwd`|Password for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--location`|`-l`  |Location of the database (e.g., `localhost`)|
|`--port`    |`-p`  |Port number (e.g., `5430`)|
|`--database-name`|`-db`|Database name|

Note that these data should comply with the requirements specified in SQLAlchemy [documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls).

To visualize the API, open your browser to here (the location and port may vary according to the script parameters or the values in `config/config.json`):

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/protocol/ui
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/protocol/openapi.json
```
### Running with Docker
To run the server on a Docker container, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Adding a new admin to the database

To generate a new api_key (passed as a query parameter "api_key") run the following:
```bash
python scripts/new_admin.py <new-admin-name> <path-to-config-file> [OPTIONS]
```
The script automatically connects to the PostgreSQL database using the config file. To override any of those values, run the script with some of the following options:

|Option|Short|Description|
|------------|-----|--|
|`--username`|`-usr`|Username for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--password`|`-pwd`|Password for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--location`|`-l`  |Location of the database (e.g., `localhost`)|
|`--port`    |`-p`  |Port number (e.g., `5430`)|
|`--database-name`|`-db`|Database name|

Note that these data should comply with the requirements specified in SQLAlchemy [documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls).


Working example for test database built from docker-compose (username and password can be found in the `config/config.json`).
```bash
python scripts/new_admin.py 'Bob' config/config.json
```
After running the script, the api_key is printed to the console:
```bash
New key for admin 'Bob':

### Configuring oAuth2

To get keycloak authentication working, all parameters in the security section of `config/config.json` need to be filled in. Most information is found in the keycloak gui.

```
"security": {
        "keycloak_url": "https://keycloak.bringauto.com",
        "client_id": "",
        "client_secret_key": "",
        "scope": "",
        "realm": "",
        "keycloak_public_key_file": "config/keycloak.pem"
    }
```

- keycloak_url : base url of a working keycloak instance
- client_id : id of client in keycloak (Clients -> click on client representing http api -> Settings -> Client ID)
- client_secret_key : secret key of client (Clients -> click on client representing http api -> Credentials -> Client Secret)
- scope : checking of scopes is not yet implemented (must be `email` for now!)
- realm : realm in which the client belongs (seen on top of the left side panel in keycloak gui)
- keycloak_public_key_file : path to public key used to decode jwt tokens (Realm settings -> Keys -> RS256 -> Public key)

### Configuration
The server settings can be found in the `config/config.json`, including the database logging information and parameters for the database cleanup.
