# Fleet v2 server


The HTTP API is described by the `openapi.yaml` according to [OpenAPI Specification](https://openapis.org).

The base of the server (e.g., entity models) was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. This includes ALL the contents of the `server/fleetv2_http_api` directory EXCEPT for:
- `impl`,
- `controllers/security_controller.py` (originally created by the Generator).

These files are included in the `server/.openapi-generator-ignore`. This file also must include itself.


## Requirements
Python 3.10.12+

## Server re-generation
You must have the OpenAPI Generator installed (see [link](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/)). Before the server generation, the server must be STOPPED.

To regenerate the server, run (in the `server` directory):
```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -g python-flask -i ../openapi.yaml -o . -p=packageName=fleetv2_http_api
```
Below is an example of running the Generator with the port number being specified (the default is `8080`):
```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -g python-flask -i ../openapi.yaml -o . -p=packageName=fleetv2_http_api,serverPort=<port-number>
```
If you have trouble with running the generator, visit [docs](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/).


## Tests

Testing of a cloned repository requires two steps:

- install this package,
- run the tests (or their subset).

**Before installation, make sure you have the [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) activated.** This is a necessary step to avoid conflicts with the system packages.

## Package installation

Run the command below in the root directory. `-e` is used to install the package in the [editable mode](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode).

```bash
pip install [-e] .
```

## Running the tests

In the root directory, run the following

```bash
python -m tests [-h] [PATH1] [PATH2] ...
```

Each PATH is specified relative to the `tests` directory. If no PATH is specified, all the tests will run. Otherwise

- when PATH is a directory, the script will run all tests in this directory (and subdirectories),
- when PATH is a Python file, the script will run all tests in the file.

The `-h` flag makes the script display tests' coverage in an HTML format, for example in your web browser.

The same applies to integration tests using containerized HTTP servers.

WARNING: The integration tests require about 5-10 minutes to run.

To run the integration tests, run the following in the root directory:

```bash
python -m tests_integration [-h] [PATH1] [PATH2] ...
```


## Usage

To run the server execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m server <path-to-config-file> [OPTIONS]
```
The server automatically connects to the PostgreSQL database using data from the config file. If you want to override these values, start the server with some of the following options:

|Option|Short|Description|
|------------|-----|--|
|`--username`|`-usr`|Username for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--password`|`-pwd`|Password for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--location`|`-l`  |Location of the database (e.g., `localhost`)|
|`--port`    |`-p`  |Port number (e.g., `5430`)|
|`--database-name`|`-db`|Database name|

Note that these data should comply with the requirements specified in SQLAlchemy [documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls).

To visualize the API, open your browser here (the location and port may vary according to the script parameters or the values in `config/config.json`):

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/protocol/ui
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/protocol/openapi.json
```
### Running with Docker
To run the server on a Docker container, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Adding a new admin to the database

To generate a new api_key (passed as a query parameter "api_key") run the following:
```bash
python scripts/new_admin.py <new-admin-name> <path-to-config-file> [OPTIONS]
```
The script automatically connects to the PostgreSQL database using the config file. To override any of those values, run the script with some of the following options:

|Option|Short|Description|
|------------|-----|--|
|`--username`|`-usr`|Username for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--password`|`-pwd`|Password for the PostgreSQL database|
|`--location`|`-l`  |Location of the database (e.g., `localhost`)|
|`--port`    |`-p`  |Port number (e.g., `5430`)|
|`--database-name`|`-db`|Database name|

Note that these data should comply with the requirements specified in SQLAlchemy [documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls).


Working example for test database built from docker-compose (username and password can be found in the `config/config.json`).
```bash
python scripts/new_admin.py 'Bob' config/config.json
```
After running the script, the api_key is printed to the console:
```bash
New key for admin 'Bob':

### Configuring oAuth2

To get Keycloak authentication working, all parameters in the security section of `config/config.json` need to be filled in. Most information is found in the Keycloak GUI.

```
"security": {
        "keycloak_url": "https://keycloak.bringauto.com",
        "client_id": "",
        "client_secret_key": "",
        "scope": "",
        "realm": ""
    }
```

- keycloak_url : base URL of a working Keycloak instance
- client_id : id of client in Keycloak (Clients -> click on client representing HTTP API -> Settings -> Client ID)
- client_secret_key : secret key of client (Clients -> click on client representing HTTP API -> Credentials -> Client Secret)
- scope : checking of scopes is not yet implemented (must be `email` for now!)
- realm : realm in which the client belongs (seen on top of the left side panel in Keycloak GUI)

### Configuration
The server settings can be found in the `config/config.json`, including the database logging information and parameters for the database cleanup.
